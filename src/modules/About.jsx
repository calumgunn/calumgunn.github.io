        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Cameron Shafii is an Iranian composer practicing generative and electroacoustic music. His
        compositions are inflected with a host of digital synthesis processes and are informed by
        aspects of acousmatic theory, particularly spectromorphology. His works do not impose any
        temporal scheme upon the listener - rejecting the semiotic operation of
        'engagement/disengagement'.</p>

        <p>'Pithy & Prolix' - his forthcoming piece for the An√≤mia label - features sound scenes that
        emphasize the materiality and morphology of spatial textures. In it, Shafii presents an
        asymmetrical narrative that articulates tension, amorphous forms and complex sonorities,
        signifying a plurality of meaning and complication.</p>

        <p>Shafii has performed at concerts, festivals, installations, and workshops in the US and Canada,
        and has collaborated on an ongoing basis with dance artist Beth Graczyk. He runs the Ge-stell
        label and is currently based in Seattle, Washington.</p>
